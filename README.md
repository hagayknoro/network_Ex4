# Network_Ex4
Creating ping and modify it into new option.
## Two parts for Ex4   
In the first part we send ping for Google's port and we receive reply for the send request.
In the second part we add Timer, his job is to count the sec between the send ping request and the send reply, if we get that the sec is more than 10, kill the process and close the program.    
For first hakf we create ping.c file.    
For the second part we create better_ping.c and wathdog.c files.
